								<h2>About us</h2>
								<p>In 2012, I became a Certified Dog Behaviour Specialist because of my love for dogs and because of the frustrations of seeing so many dogs in shelters that had been abandoned because they were misunderstood or mismanaged by their humans. Understanding breed characteristics, instincts, drives and temperament permits the comprehension of a dogâ€™s behaviour and therefore allows me the ability to shape and rehabilitate any unnecessary or unwanted behaviours through gentle training methods, allowing our dogs the opportunity to become well mannered, well behaved and less likely to be given up to a shelter.</p>
								<h2>JUST A DOG</h2>
								<p>From time to time, people tell me, "lighten up, it's just a dog,"or "that's a lot of money for just a dog."
								They don't understand the distance travelled, the time spent,or the costs involved for "just a dog."
								Some of my proudest moments have come about with "just a dog."<br>
								
								Many hours have passed and my only company was "just a dog," but I did not once feel slighted.
								Some of my saddest moments have been brought aobut by "just a dog," and in those days of darkness, the gentle touch of "just a dog" gave me comfort and reason to overcome the day.<br>
								
								If you, too, think it's "just a dog," then you probably understand phrases like "just a friend," "just a sunrise," or "just a promise."
								"Just a dog" brings into my life the very essence of friendship, trust, and pure unbridled joy.
								"Just a dog" brings out the compassion and patience
								that make me a better person. Because of "just a dog" I will rise early, take long walks and look longingly to the future.<br>
								
								So for me and folks like me, it's not "just a dog"
								but an embodiment of all the hopes and dreams of the future, the fond memories of the past, and the pure joy of the moment.<br>
								
								"Just a dog" brings out what's good in me and diverts my thoughts away from myself and the worries of the day.
								I hope that someday they can understand that its' not "just a dog" but the thing that gives me humanity and keeps me from being "just a man" or "just a woman."
								So the next time you hear the phrase "just a dog,"
								just smile, because they "just don't understand."</p>
